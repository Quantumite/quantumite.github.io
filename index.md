## Bio
I enjoy doing cyber security research and my main interests are C/C++ development, Assembly programming, Malware Analysis, and Reverse Engineering. I'm a huge fan of Ghidra and Python for scripting.

I completed my Ph.D. at [Dakota State University](https://www.dsu.edu) in March of 2024. My dissertation is publically available [here](https://scholar.dsu.edu/theses/448/).
